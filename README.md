# Weather Dahboard App
This application uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve and display weather data for whichever city the user enters in the search field.  The dashboard displays relevant info about current weather in a desired city, as well as a 5-day forecast for that same city.  Successful past searches are automatically saved to list of clickable links below the search bar should the user wish to re-run one of those searches again later.
